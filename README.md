# LinuxRPG
My first Linux RPG game

This is the place for my linux RPG game
Dark fantasy game, Open GL, Blender, C++

Having fun and learning along the way!

p.s. Actually, I am mostly learning about OpenGL but it is
so much more fun when learning have a context, thus learning through
context of my favourite genre-RPG!
